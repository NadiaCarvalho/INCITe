# My Musical Suggester

Version 1.3-alpha

![Python application](https://github.com/NadiaCarvalho/Dissertation/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg?branch=master)

This repository presents **My Musical Suggester**, an application that generates multiple solutions, e.g. continuations, for a given musical context, ordered by their similarity to the original, so that the user can make his choice or even, from time to time, provoke the composer to come up with new ideas. 

It works as a standalone application or as a plugin for the MuseScore (https://musescore.org/en) notation software.
